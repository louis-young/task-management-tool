# Task Manager

A React application to manage and locally persist tasks.

![Task Manager](documentation/task-manager.jpg)

## Description

This is an application which allows you to manage and persist tasks which you need to complete. It has a slick and intuitive user interface with features such as inline editing and drag-and-drop.

## Motivation

I built this application to learn more about React, and reducers and state management specifically.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
